How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It showed the lines that had changed.  

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would be easy to see how you did things before you screwed them up.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Doing them manually is based on logical milestones which only the programmer can judge.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git was written as a solution for programming.  Docs for instance only deals with a single file which is not linked.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log shows the commit history, and git diff shows what has changed between specific commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I don't have to remember exactly what I changed and can easily reverse it if need be.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

The PP project.
