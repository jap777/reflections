What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches allow for having different versions of your code which you can
checkout later to make them the active branch.  1) Using git branch to get the
status of branches in your repository, 2) git branch <some name> to create a
new branch.  3) Use git checkout <branch name> to revert to the named branch.  
4) "master" is always the main branch.  All repositories have a "master"

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

You can see the tree structure.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

We combine a branch into the master.  The diagram becomes flat again.


What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

It can merge most things logically, but major conflicts need to be manually
done.
