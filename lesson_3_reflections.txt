When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate or share intellect with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because others may alter the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones from one account to another on gitHub, clones are making
copies of your repository, and branches are diversions from the main branch of
a project such as an experimental version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So, conflict resolution can occur on the hub.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be very difficult.  FTP, with manual diffs.  Spreadsheets??

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you're working with GitHub, you use a separate branch to make
pull-requests.
